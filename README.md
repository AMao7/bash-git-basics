# Bash

## Bash is a shell program that takes commands that you type and (once you hit return), translates those commands into (ultimately) system calls to the Operating System API. It is used to emulate a LINUX environment

# Bash Basics

'pwd' is the print working directory and prints the path of the working directory
'ls' known as list short, lists information about files and directories within the file system
'ls -a' list short all information including hidden files
'll' list
'mkdir' (name of new folder) creates location
'cd(folder), takes you to new location
'cat (file)',  examines file
'clear', to wipe text
'cd ..', to go back one directory
 'touch' (name of new folder), creates file
'rm (file)', removes file
'rm -rf (file)', removes everything inside, f is to force (cannot be in the same directory)

# Git

## Git is version control, the purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository.

# Git Basics

'git init' , start a new project, master
'git status',  status of git file
'git add .',  adds everything (ready for commit)
'git commit', saves the changes
'git commit -m 'message'', adds comment to the changes
'git log ', see previous commits
'git checkout master', takes you to closest update
'git checkout (commit number)', takes you to that timeline
'git push', to push all commits
